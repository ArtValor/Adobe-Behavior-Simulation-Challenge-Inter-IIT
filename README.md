# Adobe-Behavior-Simulation-Challenge

## Overview
The problem statement is based on the fundamental process of communication in marketing, focusing on behavior simulation (Task-1) and content simulation (Task-2) to assist marketers in estimating and enhancing user engagement on social media platforms. The team aims to provide solutions for simulating user behavior and creating content that effectively elicits the desired KPIs, offering valuable insights for optimizing social media strategies.

## Objective
Companies often rely heavily on leveraging the power of social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. to promote their products, boost sales, and build a brand identity. Thus, it is important for companies to optimize their posts to maximize user interaction and ensure efficiency in their campaigns.
User engagement on Twitter is quantified by metrics like user likes, retweets, comments, mentions, follows, clicks on embedded media and links. For this challenge, we consider the number of likes to be our KPI for user engagement. The given problem statement consists of the following two tasks:

• Task 1: Given the content of a tweet, the task is to predict its user engagement, measured by likes.

• Task 2: Given the tweet metadata, generate the tweet text.

The team has leveraged the latest advancements in Deep Learning and Generative AI to tackle the above two tasks. The approaches used are described in detail in the proceeding sections of this report.
